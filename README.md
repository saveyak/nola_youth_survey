For their 2020 report "Voices of New Orleans Youth: What Do the City's Young People Think About Their Schools and Communities?," researchers at the Education Research Alliance for New Orleans surveyed over 3,800 local students about their educational experiences. They found huge disparities in how Black and White students rate their teachers, schools, and relationship with the police -- for example, while 69% of White students feel safer in the presence of police, only 40% of Black students do. I used the ggplot2 package in R to turn the survey data into graphs that highlighted these glaring disparities.
